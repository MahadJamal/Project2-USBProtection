# Project2-USBProtection

This project is aimed to protect an unauthorized person to plug in USB storage device to copy the data. This program disables the USB storage devices till the admin authorizes for the use of the USB by Enabling USB storage devices option on the PC.

There are two methods to prevent USB storage devices to not work in windows operating system.

## Method 1:
We can disable the USB storage devices from the windows registry. This process needs to be done very careful to avoid messing up anything else in the registry. 

## Method 2:
Detect USB storage devices being plugged in and once any such device is detected, use shell methods to eject that device.


##Detailed Explanation:
